    branches:
      - '**'  # Run on all branches

# Define the job to run the unit tests using a matrix for multiple Python versions
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Use the latest Ubuntu runner

    # Use a matrix strategy to test across multiple Python versions

    # Define the steps for setting up the environment and running tests

      # Step 1: Checkout the repository's code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Python environment based on the matrix version
