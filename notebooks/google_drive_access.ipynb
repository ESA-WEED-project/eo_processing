    "In WEED we want to use files from the GoogleDrive for the processing - mainly in the benchmarking part of the project. MOreover, some of the results of the benchmarking should be directly uploaded to the GDrive and therefore available for all user. The following steps had to be implemented to access the GDrive from Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign in to the WEED Google Account and open the Google Cloud Console to create a project. <br>\n",
    "  - go to https://console.cloud.google.com/  <br>\n",
    "  - Create a New Project: Click on “Select a project” at the top and then “New Project”. Give it a name and create. Name is \"WEED-2024\"\n",
    "2. enable the Google Drive API for the WEED project <br>\n",
    "  - Navigate to APIs & Services: In the left sidebar, go to “APIs & Services” > “Dashboard”.\n",
    "  - Enable APIs: Click on “Enable APIs and Services”. Search for “Google Drive API” and enable it for your project.\n",
    "3. create credentials\n",
    "  - Generate Credentials: In the left sidebar, go to “APIs & Services” > “Credentials”.\n",
    "  - Create Credentials: Click “Create Credentials” > “Service Account”. Fill in details, choose a role, and create a JSON key. Save this JSON key securely.\n",
    "    - Name: gdrive_access\n",
    "    - Email: gdrive-access@weed-2024.iam.gserviceaccount.com (automatic generation)\n",
    "    - enable the service account status\n",
    "4. JSON access key\n",
    "  - Download and Use JSON Key: Store the downloaded JSON key securely on your local machine. This key will be used for authenticating your application to access the Drive API. (The service account key can only be retrieved the first time)\n",
    "  - Therefore, if you need a new key just add a new key to the gdrive_access credentials!!!!!\n",
    "  - BEST: store the key in a secure location like the VITO valut and access it from there client-side (https://confluence.vito.be/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=EP&title=Vault+user+guide)\n",
    "  - link to the VITO vault which you can access with your TERRASCOPE credentials: https://vault.vgt.vito.be/ui/vault/auth?with=ldap\n",
    "5. make sure that for each file and folder which should be available in Python the servie account email address is added to the \"access\" of these files and folders. Currently only the folder \"openeo_tests\" under WEED/working/WP4_ToolboxDvlpt is granted access in this way.\n",
